"""
KiCad Routing Tools - headless placement-run contracts (Placement tab).

The Placement tab drives Claude Code headless with the /pcb-free-agent skill,
in its `place` or `full` mode. Unlike the "Ask AI" analysis skills,
those runs WRITE (lap boards, a converge ledger, REPORT.md, the movie), take
minutes to hours, and must be observable from the outside while they run.

This module holds everything about such a run that is not wx: the workdir
layout, the instruction/RESULT contracts, and the read-only pollers the GUI's
monitor timer uses to answer "what is it doing right now" (ledger tail, board
artifacts, stage derivation). Intentionally wx-free so tests can import it
headless, mirroring ai_backend.py.

"""Route, preview and unroute one placement BLOCK (#459 follow-on).

`placement/groups.py` answers "which footprints belong together". This answers
the three things you then want to do with that block:

    route    scope a routing run to just the block's nets
    preview  route it and report what WOULD change, writing nothing
    undo     remove the block's routed copper, putting it back to unrouted

Scope has two honest readings, and both are useful because which one you want
depends on the block:

    internal   nets whose every pad is inside the block. A schematic sheet is
               60-70% internal (glasgow's two 68-part sheets: 52 internal vs 23
               boundary), so "route this sheet" is a real, self-contained job.
    touching   nets with ANY pad inside the block -- the block's interface to the
               rest of the board included. This matches what `--component`
               already means, and it is the ONLY useful reading for a decap
               block: those are 0% internal by construction, since a decoupling
               cap bridges VCC to GND and both span the board.

Neither is right in general, so the caller picks.

    Returns (new content, report). Text surgery on the same helpers the
    dead-end sweep and the plane cleanup use, so KiCad 9/10 net spellings and
    quoted net names are handled the same way everywhere.

    Refuses KiCad-LOCKED copper. Locked means the user pinned it, and #521 gives
    that no override anywhere else in the toolchain -- an undo is not the place
    to invent one. Nets protected for a REASON (length-matched, time-matched,
    diff-pair) are removed: naming a net exactly is deliberate targeting, which
    is precisely the override those reasons are written to allow.

    What this does NOT undo, and cannot:
      * pad/target SWAPS. route.py can exchange which pad a net lands on, which
        mutates nets OUTSIDE the block, and no inverse exists in the codebase.
      * copper the router removed as a dead end or stale via -- that is gone
        from the input by the time you see the output.
      * ZONE pours (reported as `zones_left`). A filled plane IS copper on the
        net, so a net with a surviving pour is not back to "no copper". Deleting
        a pour is a plane decision, not an undo, so this reports and leaves it.
      * `(arc ...)` tracks and copper GRAPHICS (reported as `unmatched`). Both
        land in `pcb_data.segments` -- the parser linearizes arcs -- but the text
        writer only matches `(segment ...)` blocks; kicad_parser's own field doc
        says of graphics "writers cannot strip it (there is no (segment) block to
        match)". Counted and surfaced rather than silently left behind.
    A board that had swaps applied is not returned to its prior state by this;
    it is returned to "these nets carry no copper", minus the caveats above.

    The sibling project's `protected_nets` / `net_impedance` records are carried
    across UNCHANGED, so a net can stay marked length-matched or impedance-spec'd
    after its copper is gone. That is deliberate: the declaration describes what
    the net REQUIRES, not what is currently on the board, and re-routing it
    should honor the same spec. It does mean the record briefly describes copper
    that is not there.

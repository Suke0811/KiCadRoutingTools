"""A custom pad's copper is its primitives, not a box around its anchor.

The parser stores a CUSTOM pad as a symmetric box about its anchor, sized to
enclose the real primitives. That is deliberate and safe for clearance work
(it over-blocks), and wrong for CONNECTIVITY, because the anchor is frequently
a corner of the copper rather than its centre.

Measured on a recorded board: a MOSFET tab whose real copper is 4.57 x 5.01mm
was modelled as 9.13 x 10.01mm -- four times the area -- with the box centre
3.4mm away from the copper centre. The connectivity graph then credited any
track passing within min(size)/4 = 2.28mm of the ANCHOR as landing on the pad,
and that disc sat largely in empty space. Two islands of one net each reached
the phantom disc, so the net graded CONNECTED with its copper in two pieces --
and the router skipped it as already routed. A silent open.

The exact-distance path was always right; it uses the polygons. Only the credit
disc was derived from the box. Now it comes from the primitives when they are
there.

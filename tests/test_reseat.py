"""Re-seating a constrained cluster by assignment instead of freezing it.

Parts under a proximity rule get LOCKED, because the quench has no proximity
term and will otherwise walk one member past the limit every run. That works,
and it freezes exactly the parts whose re-seating produced most of a run's
placement wins.

The trick under test: make the proximity rule the DEFINITION of the slot pool,
so every candidate satisfies it by construction and no proximity cost term is
ever needed. What is left is an assignment problem, and it is exactly additive
because each member is scored with every other member's pads overridden to an
empty list.

The properties that make it safe are what these assert:

  * identity is always feasible, so "leave it alone" is a possible answer;
  * acceptance is on the EXACT cluster objective, so a lying surrogate can
    waste time but never ship a worse board;
  * two members never end up in the same place, even though Hungarian returns
    distinct slot INDICES rather than non-overlapping courtyards;
  * no RNG anywhere -- same input, same answer.

"""The #411 recovery grader must be trustworthy before anything is measured with it.

These are all pure-function tests over pose dictionaries: no perturbation, no
routing, no subprocesses. That is deliberate -- the metric has to be provable
independently of the tool that will feed it, or a bug in one hides a bug in the
other.

The load-bearing test here is `test_the_grader_can_say_WORSE`. A grader that can
only report improvement is not a grader, and every other property in this file
is worth less if that one does not hold.

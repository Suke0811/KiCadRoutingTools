"""Regression test for issue #628 (LIVE half) -- a candidate rect that SWALLOWS a
milled interior contour whole was judged LEGAL.

`BoardOutlineGate`'s two exact tests work from a rect's four corners and four
edges. A rect large enough to contain an entire interior ring passes both: every
corner is on-board (a milled contour is not a cutout, so it does not make its
interior off-board) and no rect edge comes within the margin of a ring edge. The
"swallowed ring" probe exists precisely for that case -- but it iterated
`self.cutouts` only, so it never saw `board_edge_contours`, the milled Edge.Cuts
geometry `drop_pad_containing_cutouts` reclassifies (#505). A part could be
placed straight over a milled slot and `violation()` reported 0.0.

The boundary-CROSSING case was already handled (the rect's own edges come within
the margin of the milled ring's edges, and `board_edge_geometry` puts those rings
in `rings`); this test pins that as a control so the fix is not mistaken for it.

NOT part of the fix, deliberately: milled contours are given no CONTAINMENT
semantics. `board_edge_contours` mixes a real inner OUTLINE (interior = board:
crkbd, bus_pirate5) with a milled SLOT (interior = not board) and the parser
cannot tell them apart, so declaring the interior off-board re-opens #291
(bus_pirate5 lost all 870 pads). "A part may not swallow a milled ring" is true
under both readings. The final check below pins that non-rule.

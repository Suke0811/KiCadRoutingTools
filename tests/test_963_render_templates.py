"""A render that writes its keys to a file must not also print them (#963).

Run 29 built 13 review sheets and 10 of them printed every checklist key before
the picture could be looked at. The blind-first ordering is the whole mechanism
of the boundary review -- `SKILL.md`: "VIEW it, write your observations ...
**before reading any checklist key**" -- and the commands the review gates
prescribe were the ones defeating it, because ten of the thirteen render
templates the two drivers emit omitted `--quiet`.

TWO SEPARATE DEFECTS, and the second is the one the issue does not name:

  * `--quiet` missing. Measured below, on a real board: the flag takes stdout
    from tens of lines carrying `checklist` to three that carry none, and both
    forms still write the PNG and the JSON. Nothing is silenced into nowhere.
  * `--review-sheet` missing, which made a live guard unable to fire.
    `placement_driver._guard_render`'s fifth check reads
    `doc.get('review_sheet') if 'review_sheet' in doc else ''` and treats an
    ABSENT key as "never asked for" -- correctly, for a render produced
    elsewhere. But `render_placement` writes that key only under
    `if args.review_sheet:`, and no template passed the flag, so the guard
    could not fire on a single render the driver's own text produced. Its
    self-test reached it by hand-injecting the key. That is a gate whose
    population was empty, which looks exactly like a gate with nothing to
    report.

The rule itself -- `--json-out` implies `--quiet` unless `--pair` or `--focus`
makes the narrative the deliverable -- is held over every emitted command by
`tests/test_431_skill_commands.py::
test_a_render_that_writes_its_keys_to_a_file_does_not_print_them`, which shares
that file's `--dump-all`/`--dump-refusals` cache. This file is the part that
has to RUN something.

placement_driver was retired with its skill, so the checks that read ITS
emitted recipe and self-test text left with it; what `render_placement` does
with the flags is still pinned here.

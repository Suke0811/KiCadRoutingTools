"""#959 / #999: pad-less blocks are counted, answered for, and never crash.

Run 29's P1 printed "6 zoned block(s) cover all 13 movable part(s)" on a board
of 21 footprint blocks. The denominator was `if fp.pads` -- what the seeder
moves -- and so it hid exactly the three blocks the seeder never touches: the
pad-less logos. One of them sat at the pile origin for 12 laps printing silk
across CON2's apertures, found by eye rather than by any gate. And asking
`converge poses` about one of them died in a KeyError traceback at exit 1, the
same code as the verdict "no legal pose".

Traps written against:

  * the old advice was wrong for exactly these blocks -- "add each to a block
    with a zone" does nothing to a block the seeder never places, so an arm
    asserts a zoned pad-less block is REFUSED as inert rather than accepted;
  * `must_lock` looks like an answer and is not one -- it stamps a lock the
    seeder writes after seating, and this block is never seated;
  * a non-zero exit is not evidence: every CLI arm asserts the reason, and
    the converge arm asserts there is NO traceback.

The P1 pad-less census and its refusals lived in the retired placement_driver
and left with it (its `dispositions.refs` judgement survives as
`floorplan.stale_dispositions`, pinned in test_959_rule_roster). What stays is
the board fact, the grade, and the three CLIs that must refuse, not crash.

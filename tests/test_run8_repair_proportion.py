"""A repair moves the part that can move, by an amount the damage justifies.

Two run-7 defects in the repair seat loop, and one design mistake I made
fixing them.

A17 -- the mover chooser picks one member of a conflicting pair by
(pin_count, ref) and charges it. When that member has no legal seat anywhere,
the pair is reported unrepairable while its PARTNER may have had a seat
available the whole time. One board shipped exactly that.

  The obvious fix -- charge both members -- is WRONG, and the corpus sweep
  caught it: on a board with one genuine 0.04mm pair it moved a second part
  0.50mm, and both the old and new outputs graded 0 violations. Churn away
  from the original placement is the very failure the other fix here exists to
  stop. So the partner is a FALLBACK, tried only when the preferred mover
  fails.

R3 -- the cap ladder escalates 0.5 -> 1.0 -> 2.0 -> 5.0mm hunting any legal
seat, with nothing relating the move to the damage. On a board perturbed by
1.2mm it relocated parts 4.3-5.8mm from truth, and those few parts carried the
whole of that run's negative recovery: excluding three of them took it from
-0.296 to -0.058, and excluding seven made it positive. A seat that far away is
not a repair, it is a different placement.

"""#1051 phase 2: the array DETECTOR -- it suggests, it is pose-blind, and
what it suggests on the real boards is pinned against their real nets.

What each case pins, and why:

* glasgow_revC: the 33R resistor arrays split into PAIRS by channel -- RN7+
  RN8 (IO_Buffer_A) and RN1+RN2 (IO_Buffer_B) each on four balls of U30,
  RN9+RN10 / RN3+RN4 on connectors J2 / J3. The issue's "RN1-4 & RN7-10
  serving U30" is NOT what the nets say: RN3/4/9/10 reach U30 only through
  the SN74LVC1T45 buffers. The 17 buffers meet `pin_run` on U30 (pin 5, the
  DAx/DBx bus) as 8 + 8 by sheet; U32 is the 17th, alone on the top sheet
  on a different net, and is suggested nowhere.
* splitflap: the seven 47k resistors, each on its own pin of U4, in U4's
  pin order (pads 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).
* ulx3s: the 549R resistors on U1 split by sheet into the eight LED
  resistors (blinkey), three analog and two GPDI -- 13 on U1, not the 17 a
  count of "shares any net with U1" gives (that count includes +3V3/GND).
* a negative control that cannot pass vacuously: the same synthetic parts
  give no suggestion without a common part, and one WITH it.
* pose-blindness: identical output after every footprint pose and pad
  position is randomised in memory -- and `groups.chip_refs`, which DOES read
  poses, changes on the same randomised board, so the shuffle was strong
  enough to move a pose-reading predicate.
* `array_formation` on the HUMAN glasgow for the detected rows (count
  reported), every resistor-array row formed, and one shuffled member fails.
* `emit_intent`: the default writes no `arrays`; `'auto'` writes them with a
  `why` naming the criterion and no evidence bulk, and round-trips through
  `load_intent` and `grade` with no array_unresolved / array_conflict.
* the CLI: `--suggest-arrays` stdout is bare JSON equal to the in-process
  answer, and it refuses to run with `--intent`, for its stated reason.

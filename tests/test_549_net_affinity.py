"""Per-part net affinity: the part that carries a net its block sits away from.

`block_displacements` asks the block-level question and averages the per-part
answer away. This is the inverse, and the case it exists for is measured: on a
real board a series resistor zoned into a far-edge block carried 85.7% of a
critical bus net's routed length, forcing ten drop-vias and eight
reference-plane voids -- and four runs went by with nothing measuring it.

The tests use a hand-built state whose answer is known by construction, so a
regression points at the arithmetic rather than at a board.

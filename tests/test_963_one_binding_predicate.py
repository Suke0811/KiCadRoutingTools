"""ONE predicate for "does this score grade this board" (#963).

#963's contributor measured the symptom from outside the repo: `converge
record --kind systemic --score-file <a stale score>` returned exit 0 and wrote
`accepted: true` with only a stderr WARNING, while `loop_driver --stage L5`
handed the SAME pair refused at exit 4. They called it "different enforcement
strengths", and the strengths are fine -- a baseline row legitimately attaches a
parent score to a rejected candidate, a close-out legitimately does not. What
was not fine is that the two answers came from two different implementations of
one question, and there were FIVE of them:

    py_placer/converge.py    _grades_another_board          a bool, used once
    py_placer/converge.py    cmd_record, inline             warns; re-parsed
                                                            a.score behind a
                                                            bare except, a
                                                            SECOND read of
                                                            bytes already
                                                            parsed 200 lines up
    loop_driver.py           _score_board_mismatch          refuses (L3)
    loop_driver.py           _verdict, inline               refuses (L5)
    loop_driver.py           _close_out, inline             refuses, about the
                                                            close-out document

THE ONLY TEST HERE THAT CATCHES A REINTRODUCED COPY IS THE AST ONE. Every
behavioural assertion below passes just as happily with five implementations as
with one -- that is precisely how five of them arrived. So the first test walks
the syntax tree and refuses a sixth, in the shape of `tests/test_711_sibling_
lists.py`, which refuses a tenth sibling list for the same reason.

The scan asserts it FOUND the expected sites before it asserts it found nothing
else: a silently-empty walk reads exactly like a pass.

WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE, named rather than implied:

  * It scans ONE FILE, converge.py. The three loop_driver.py sites, and
    the driver's local fallback that the driver-only tests here pinned, were
    retired with that driver.
    `py_tools/render_placement.py` (~:570, ~:641-651)
    holds a sixth site of the same shape -- hand-rolled on `hashlib`, matching
    / mismatch-skips / no-sha-notes -- and degrades the same way. #963 does not
    touch it, and widening the scan to the whole tree would make every
    legitimate content hash in the repo a finding.
  * It is syntax, not semantics. A copy that routes the compare through a
    helper of its own, or through a dict lookup, is invisible.

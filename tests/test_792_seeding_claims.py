"""The committed change detector for `tests/measure_792_seeding.py`'s rows.

The measurement itself runs three full seeds per board and takes minutes, so it
is not collected. This file reads the rows it committed and RE-DERIVES every
aggregate the PR body quotes -- it does not sample, and it does not compare a
sampled cell against a constant. `test_554_reach_regen`'s recorded scar is that
an earlier version of exactly this shape sampled two cells and checked the other
twenty-two against the baseline, so five of its seven checks were tautologies
and it printed PASS while the sweep's headline halved.

WHY THE ROWS EXIST AT ALL, rather than a `test_placement_ab.py` row.
That harness's `_run` calls `quench(...)`; nothing in the table calls
`seed_from_intent`, and `_intent_for` emits without `derive_decaps` so every
existing row's intent carries `decaps: {}` and no decap rule can arm. Hosting a
seed row means a new arm kind inside a gate seven pinned rows depend on -- a
change to the gate, made in the PR whose evidence the gate would produce. So the
properties that gate enforces -- pairing, >= 3 distinct boards, a direction
rather than an absolute -- are enforced HERE instead, and the harness is left
alone.

One caveat this file states rather than hides: the `off` arm carries NO
`decaps` key, so `off` vs `on` measures what DECLARING the key costs, not what
#792 changed. That pair is therefore RECORDED and not gated. The base-vs-head
comparison that does measure #792 needs two worktrees and is quoted in the PR
body.

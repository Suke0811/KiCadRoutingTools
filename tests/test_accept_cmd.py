"""`place_route_loop --accept-cmd`: an external, spec-aware accept test.

The built-in comparator is `failures`, then `iterations`. That is all it can
see. A board with a real specification is decided by things it has no term for
-- a maximum routed length, a via ban, a required track width, a
decap-proximity limit -- so a loop driven by it will accept a round that broke
one of them and call the result an improvement.

`--accept-cmd` hands that judgement to the caller, who is the only party that
knows what the spec says. The contract is deliberately small so a judge can be a
five-line shell script:

    CMD <placed.kicad_pcb> <routed.kicad_pcb> <route.json>  ->  SCORE=<float>

Lower is better. Anything that is not a parseable SCORE line on a zero exit is a
REJECT, because a judge that cannot answer is not evidence that the round was
good.

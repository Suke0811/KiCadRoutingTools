"""Off-board is measured against the OUTLINE, not the bounding rectangle.

The reconstruct gate's third term is "did this candidate push copper off the
board". It used to compute that from the board's bounding RECTANGLE while every
other instrument used the real Edge.Cuts outline. On a rectangular board the two
agree; on any board with a notch, a cutout or a non-convex edge they do not, and
the gate is blind exactly where evacuation is easiest.

Measured on two recorded run-7 boards (bounding-rect term -> outline-aware term
at the same poses):

    one board:     0.0000 mm  ->  6.7177 mm
    another:       0.0000 mm  ->  5.5190 mm
    a rectangular board:  0.0000 mm  ->  0.0000 mm   (no false positive)

That 0.0 is what let a candidate sweeping nine parts into a notch pass the
"oob may not worsen" conjunct: the term could not see it.

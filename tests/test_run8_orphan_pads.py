"""A pad is not a circle, and a trace end is not a point (run-7 A8).

check_orphan_stubs modelled every pad as a circle of diameter max(w, h) about
its centre and ignored the width of the trace whose endpoint it was testing.
Both approximations are wrong in both directions:

  * a square pad's corner copper lies OUTSIDE that circle, so a trace ending in
    the corner reads as a dead end;
  * a 1.5 x 0.9 pad's circle reaches 0.3mm past the long edges, so a stub that
    really does end in empty copper reads as connected;
  * the endpoint is the CENTRE of the trace's end cap, whose copper extends
    half a track width further -- one measured false orphan sat 0.01mm outside
    a pad its cap overlapped by 0.19mm.

A false orphan is not cosmetic: one drove a net split a watcher had to unpick.

Measured A/B on recorded run-7 boards (before -> after this fix):
    one board's final:      1 orphan  -> 0
    another board's repair: 3 orphans -> 1   (the real one is retained)

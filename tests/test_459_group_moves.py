"""
Rigid block translation in the quench (issue #459).

The per-part nudge cannot express "these parts need to travel together": an IC
and its decoupling caps fight each other one at a time, because moving either
alone worsens the pair. A block move shifts the whole body by one offset.

The design constraint that makes this safe to add is the PER-MEMBER SEED CAP —
every member must still land within `max_displacement` of its own seed. That is
what keeps three existing guarantees true rather than merely probably-true:

  * `build_neighbor_lists`' exactness argument is stated per part ("a movable
    part's live position stays within travel_budget of its seed"), so the pruned
    neighbour lists stay EXACT, not lossy.
  * `BoardOutlineGate.edges_near` caches its reachable-edge list per ref on first
    call, sized by that budget — a block allowed to travel further would outrun
    the cache and silently skip the exact ring test, walking parts into cutouts.
  * `test_quench_swap_cap`'s no-stranding invariant keeps holding unmodified.

Lifting that cap is what makes #459's 80mm relocation a separate piece of work.

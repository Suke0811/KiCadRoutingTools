"""#693: every DRC-floor writer a GUI run reaches must be gated on 'fix DRC
settings'.

The GUI had TWO independent DRC writers, and only one of them was gated:

  1. apply_targets_to_board   -- netclasses + severities.  GATED.
  2. update_live_drc_floors   -- the live board's design-settings FLOORS
     (m_MinClearance, m_TrackMinWidth, m_ViasMinSize, m_MinThroughDrill,
     m_ViasMinAnnularWidth, m_HoleToHoleMin, + the Default netclass).  NOT.

So unchecking "Fix DRC settings after routing" suppressed (1) and left (2)
rewriting Board Setup anyway. The reporter watched Minimum annular width go
0.15 -> 0.05 with the box unchecked (#693). It was ungated at ALL FIVE call
sites -- every routing tab plus the plan executor -- so this is a drift guard,
not a spot fix: the CLI gates the twin (fix_project_for_output) on
--no-fix-drc-settings, and a sixth call site must not silently reintroduce the
bug.

The plan executor's end-of-plan writeback also writes the Default class's
diff-pair floors and the project file (fix_project_for_output); those were
ungated until the box became a VETO a plan cannot override. So every writer
below is held to the same rule, wherever it is called -- plus the executor's
half of the veto: the user's value goes back in a `finally`, so no way a plan
ends (completion, Stop, a raising step) leaves the box where the steps put it.

Pure AST, no wx and no pcbnew -- runs anywhere in about a second.
